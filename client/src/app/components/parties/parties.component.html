          <h1>Parties</h1> <br>
          All the FUN and none of the mess! Let our friendly Edge staff set up the party, play games with the kids and teach fun gymnastics; all you have to do is take the pictures! These kid-only events are a great way to celebrate your child’s next birthday. Parents are welcome to stay during the party in our parent viewing area.<br><br>

          Parties are 90 minutes in duration; during the first fun-filled hour your guests will enjoy our foam pit, in-ground and above-ground Tumble Tracks, Giant Hamster Ball, obstacle courses, and games designed for the ages of your guests. Following the hour of gymnastics activities, our decorated party room is available for thirty minutes for refreshments. All of this with the help of our staff.
