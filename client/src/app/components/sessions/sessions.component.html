          Our coaches are available for team girls to schedule private lessons for the purpose of receiving focused, individualized extra practice as a supplement to the learning occurring in regular practice. Private lessons are intended to be used over a set period of time to reach a specific goal (acquiring a necessary new skill, fine tuning a skill, overcoming a fear, ect.) Team gymnasts are also welcome to attend Individualized Practice Time (IPT) if additional practice is desired. <br><br>
