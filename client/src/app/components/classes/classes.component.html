<h2>Preschool Classes</h2><br>
For ages 12 months to 5 years, the Preschool Gymnastics Program at Edge is designed to teach our young students gymnastics in a safe, entertaining, and structured environment. Our goal is to teach preschoolers developmentally appropriate gymnastics activities as they also work on building confidence, socializing with other students and teachers, and having fun! The appropriate class for your child is determined by age. Within the class, the instructors will adjust the skills to challenge each child. <br>
<br>
The class levels, by age, are as follows:<br><br>
<h3>Gym Explorers:</h3> 	Gym Explorers is a 30 minute class.  This class includes parachute, circle time, exploring stations and obstacle courses, hand-eye activities, trampoline and foam pit.<br><br>
<h3>Kindergym:</h3> 	Kindergym is a 45 minute class.  This class begins with warm-ups and stretching.  Then students participate in event circuits (obstacle courses), including floor, vault, balance beam, and bar skills.  Students and parents enjoy quality time together while working on body awareness, basic tumbling skills, balancing, swinging, hand-eye coordination, and more!<br><br>
<h3>Mini-Mites:</h3> 	Mini-Mites is a 45 minute class.  Students begin with a 10 minute cardio and warm-up.  The class then participates in two gymnastics events in a circuit format and one hand-eye activity.  Students work on basic gymnastics skills while also working on social and school-readiness skills.<br><br>
<h3>Mighty-Mites:</h3> 	Mighty-Mites is a 45 minute class.  Students begin with a 10 minute cardio and warm-up.  Students participate in two gymnastics events in a circuit format and one hand-eye activity.

<h3>Dynamites:</h3> 	Dynamites is a 45 minute class.  It is a transition class between our Preschool Program and our Academy Program. Students work on perfecting their basic gymnastics skills, while working on strength, flexibility, balance, coordination, confidence and more!<br><br>
